# Rotating Navigation Project

This project involves having the entire website rotate when the hamburger icon is clicked and bringing in the navigation on the bottom left, as well as changing the icon to an "x".

The page shown was recreated from the About section on my Etsy Shop, Sadie Bloom Designs (www.sadiebloomdesigns.etsy.com).

## Objective

* Use CSS to style the elements with the show-nav container, including transition and transform.

* Use JavaScript to add or remove classes in order for the transition to begin.
